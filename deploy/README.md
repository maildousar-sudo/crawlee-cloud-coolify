# Deploy Crawlee Cloud

Choose your deployment method:

## One-Click Deploy (PaaS) — Two Steps

**Step 1:** Deploy API + Dashboard + managed databases with one click:

| Provider     | Deploy                                                                                                                                                                     | Notes                                       |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Railway      | [![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/template/crawlee-cloud?referralCode=crawlee)                                                    | Includes PostgreSQL + Redis. Easiest setup. |
| Render       | [![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/crawlee-cloud/crawlee-cloud)                | Free tier available.                        |
| DigitalOcean | [![Deploy to DO](https://www.deploytodo.com/do-btn-blue.svg)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps/new?repo=https://github.com/crawlee-cloud/crawlee-cloud&refcode=crawlee) | Managed PostgreSQL + Redis.                 |

**Step 2:** Connect a Runner on a $5 VPS so Actors can execute. See [Connecting a Runner](#connecting-a-runner-required-for-paas-deployments) below.

> **Why two steps?** The Runner needs Docker socket access to spawn Actor containers, which PaaS platforms don't provide. A cheap VPS ($5/month) handles this perfectly.

## Full Stack on VPS

Deploys everything (API + Dashboard + Runner + databases) on a single VPS with automatic HTTPS via Caddy.

### Requirements

- Ubuntu 22.04+ VPS (DigitalOcean Droplet, Hetzner, Linode, etc.)
- A domain name pointed to your server's IP
- Ports 80 and 443 open

### Deploy

SSH into your server and run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crawlee-cloud/crawlee-cloud/main/deploy/vps/deploy.sh | bash
```

Or clone and run manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/crawlee-cloud/crawlee-cloud.git
cd crawlee-cloud
bash deploy/vps/deploy.sh
```

The script will:

1. Prompt for your domain and admin email
2. Install Docker (if needed)
3. Generate all secrets automatically
4. Start all services with Caddy for auto-HTTPS
5. Print your admin credentials and URLs

### DNS Setup

Point these DNS records to your server's IP:

- `crawlee.yourdomain.com` (A record) - API
- `dashboard.crawlee.yourdomain.com` (A record) - Dashboard

Caddy will automatically provision HTTPS certificates via Let's Encrypt once DNS is active.

### Management

```bash
cd /opt/crawlee-cloud/deploy/vps

# View logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f

# Restart
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart

# Stop
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down

# Update
cd /opt/crawlee-cloud && git pull
cd deploy/vps && docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

## Connecting a Runner (required for PaaS deployments)

PaaS platforms (Railway, Render, DO) can't run Actors because they don't provide Docker socket access. You need a separate Runner on a cheap VPS ($5/month DigitalOcean Droplet or Hetzner server is enough).

### What you need from your PaaS deployment

Before starting, grab these 4 values from your PaaS dashboard:

| Value            | Where to find it                                                                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **API URL**      | Your deployed API service URL (e.g. `https://crawlee-api-production.up.railway.app`) |
| **API Secret**   | The `API_SECRET` environment variable in your API service                            |
| **Database URL** | The `DATABASE_URL` from your managed PostgreSQL addon                                |
| **Redis URL**    | The `REDIS_URL` from your managed Redis addon                                        |

### Quick setup (recommended)

SSH into your VPS and run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crawlee-cloud/crawlee-cloud/main/deploy/runner/deploy-runner.sh | bash
```

The script will prompt for the 4 values above, install Docker if needed, and start the Runner.

### Manual setup

If you prefer to set things up manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/crawlee-cloud/crawlee-cloud.git
cd crawlee-cloud
bash deploy/runner/deploy-runner.sh
```

### Verifying the connection

Once the Runner is running, you should see it picking up jobs:

```bash
cd /opt/crawlee-cloud-runner/deploy/runner
docker compose -f docker-compose.runner.yml logs -f
```

Try starting an Actor run from the Dashboard or API — you should see the Runner pick it up within seconds.

### Runner management

```bash
cd /opt/crawlee-cloud-runner/deploy/runner

# View logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.runner.yml logs -f

# Stop
docker compose -f docker-compose.runner.yml down

# Update
cd /opt/crawlee-cloud-runner && git pull
cd deploy/runner && docker compose -f docker-compose.runner.yml up -d --build
```
